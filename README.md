### Resume-CV

- This repository contains the templates for my [Resume](resume_sem_5.pdf) and [CV](https://dchandak99.github.io/files/cv.pdf)  
- To compile it into a PDF: Run **pdflatex filename.tex** on the command line  
  
**Note**:   
- The space at the top of the resume(s) is kept for the IITB header. The header can be seen in this [resume](charpak.pdf).  
- Some useful information about the moderncv template, which I have used, can be found [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/448885/how-to-add-github-link-in-moderncv-template).
